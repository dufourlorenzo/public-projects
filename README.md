## ðŸ“Š Featured Projects

### 1. **Crypto Market Analysis: BitMEX & AML/KYC Violations**
**Language:** Python
**Context:** Analyzed crypto transaction volumes and flows in response to the CFTCâ€™s regulatory action against BitMEX for AML/KYC violations.

#### Key Contributions:
- **Market Impact Analysis:** Identified a **$300M spike** in transaction volume immediately following the CFTCâ€™s announcement, driven by users exiting BitMEX.
- **Transaction Flow Tracking:** Visualized and quantified the shift from licensed to unlicensed exchanges, revealing suspicious activity patterns.
- **Regulatory Insights:** Demonstrated how regulatory actions can trigger market-wide reactions, even in decentralized ecosystems.

#### Tools & Libraries:
- **Data Processing:** Pandas
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

#### Outputs:
- Interactive visualizations of volume spikes and transaction flows.
- Evidence-based conclusions about market sentiment and compliance risks.

### 2. **Predictive Analysis of Hikes: Duration, Difficulty & Seasonality**
**Language:** R
**Context:** Built supervised and unsupervised models to estimate hike duration, classify difficulty (SAC scale), and cluster hikes by season using a dataset of 12,000+ observations.

#### Key Contributions:
- **Supervised Learning:**
  - Predicted hike duration with an **RMSE of 5,817 seconds** (~97 minutes), using features like elevation, distance, and difficulty.
  - Classified hike difficulty (T1â€“T6) with **73% accuracy**, using logistic regression.
- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - Clustered hikes into **summer/winter seasons** using k-means on speed and elevation features.
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:**
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and unrealistic entries (e.g., negative elevations, impossible speeds).
  - Created derived features like average speed and total duration.

#### Tools & Libraries:
- **Data Wrangling:** dplyr, tidyr, lubridate
- **Modeling:** leaps, pROC, glmnet
- **Visualization:** ggplot2, naniar

#### Outputs:
- Predictive models for hike planning and difficulty assessment.
- Clustering insights for seasonal hike recommendations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why These Projects?
- **Analytical Depth:** From exploratory data analysis to model deployment, I tackle end-to-end projects with rigor.
- **Technical Breadth:** Proficient in **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** and **R (Tidyverse, glmnet)** for data science and visualization.
- **Real-World Impact:** Both projects address tangible problemsâ€”**regulatory compliance in crypto** and **outdoor activity planning**â€”with actionable insights.
